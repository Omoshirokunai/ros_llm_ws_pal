Chapter 6: Results Analysis and Discussion
6.1 Introduction
This chapter presents a comprehensive analysis of our experimental evaluation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for direct robot control through natural language instructions. Our analysis reveals significant limitations and fundamental challenges in this approach.

6.2 Task Completion and System Performance
6.2.1 Task Completion Rate
The most striking finding is the 0% task completion rate across all experimental sessions. This complete failure in task completion can be attributed to several factors:

Feedback Model Limitations
Inconsistent subtask completion assessment
Difficulty in maintaining temporal context
Poor grounding between visual states and goal conditions
Control System Challenges
High latency in decision making (avg. 13.66s inference time)
Limited adaptation to environmental feedback
Poor action space grounding

6.2.2 Hallucination Analysis
The system exhibited a significant hallucination rate of 34.19%, with a clear distribution between valid and invalid commands:

Valid commands: 65.81%
Invalid commands: 34.19%
This high hallucination rate indicates fundamental issues in:

Action space grounding
Contextual understanding
Command generation constraints
6.2.3 Real-time Performance Constraints
The system's average inference time of 13.66 seconds makes it impractical for real-time applications:

Mean inference time: 13.66s
High variance in processing time
Cumulative latency impact on task execution


6.3 Safety and Control Analysis
6.3.1 Safety System Performance
The safety system analysis revealed:

Safety trigger rate: 16.67%
Human intervention rate: 25%
Limited adaptation to safety warnings
6.3.2 Control Model Response
Analysis of control model behavior showed:

Poor adaptation to safety warnings
High feedback-control mismatch rate
Limited learning from previous failures
6.3.3 Control-Feedback Alignment
The feedback-control mismatch analysis revealed:

<!-- # Add visualization of feedback adherence:
mismatches, total = analyze_feedback_control_mismatch(data)
labels = ['Followed Feedback', 'Ignored Feedback']
sizes = [(total-mismatches)/total*100, mismatches/total*100]
plt.pie(sizes, labels=labels, autopct='%1.1f%%')
plt.title('Feedback Adherence Analysis') -->

6.4 Subgoal Generation Quality
6.4.1 Subgoal Structure Analysis
Despite overall system limitations, subgoal generation showed promise:

Logical task decomposition
Clear sequential ordering
Appropriate granularity

<!-- # Add to analysis.ipynb:
def analyze_subgoal_quality(data):
    subgoals_per_task = []
    for session in data['sessions']:
        subgoals_per_task.append(len(session['subgoals']))

    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    plt.hist(subgoals_per_task, bins=range(min(subgoals_per_task), max(subgoals_per_task) + 2, 1))
    plt.title('Distribution of Subgoals per Task')
    plt.xlabel('Number of Subgoals')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency') -->


6.5 Task-Specific Analysis
6.5.1 Navigation Tasks
Performance analysis across different navigation scenarios:

Object-directed navigation: Higher failure rate due to object recognition issues
Constrained navigation: Better performance in obstacle avoidance
Human-centric navigation: Mixed results with human detection
6.5.2 Environmental Impact
Performance variations based on:

Lighting conditions
Scene complexity
Dynamic elements
6.6 Feedback Model Impact
6.6.1 Feedback Quality
Analysis of feedback model performance:

Inconsistent progress assessment
Limited spatial reasoning
Poor temporal context maintenance
6.6.2 System Adaptation
The system showed limited ability to:

Learn from previous failures
Adjust strategies based on feedback
Maintain goal-oriented behavior

6.7 Implications and Limitations
6.7.1 Architectural Limitations
High latency in decision-making
Poor grounding between perception and action
Limited feedback integration
6.7.2 Practical Constraints
Real-time operation requirements not met
Safety concerns in dynamic environments
High computational resource requirements
6.8 Summary
The experimental results demonstrate that current VLM-based direct robot control faces significant challenges that make it impractical for real-world applications. The combination of high hallucination rates, poor task completion, and significant latency issues suggests the need for fundamental architectural changes rather than incremental improvements.
