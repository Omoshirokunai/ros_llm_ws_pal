Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1 Background and Context
The integration of natural language processing with robotics represents a significant frontier in human-robot interaction. As robots become increasingly prevalent in everyday environments, the need for intuitive and natural interfaces for robot control becomes paramount. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and reasoning about visual scenes, suggesting their potential for bridging the gap between natural language commands and physical robot control.

1.2 Current Situation
Current approaches to robot control typically rely on:

Pre-programmed motion primitives
Structured command languages
Specialized interfaces requiring technical expertise
Limited contextual understanding
While these methods are functional, they create barriers to widespread robot adoption and limit the accessibility of robotic systems to non-technical users. Recent advances in VLMs like LLaVA suggest the possibility of more natural interaction paradigms, but their direct application to robot control remains largely unexplored.


1.3 Problem Statement
This research addresses the fundamental challenge of enabling direct robot control through natural language commands using vision-language models. Specifically, we investigate whether current VLM architectures can:

Reliably translate natural language navigation instructions into safe robot actions
Ground visual perception in physical control decisions
Maintain task coherence through continuous visual feedback
Provide sufficient safety guarantees for real-world deployment
The core research question is: "Can vision-language models be effectively integrated with existing robot control systems to enable safe and reliable natural language navigation while maintaining operational safety constraints?"

1.4 Research Significance
This work contributes to several key areas:

Natural Human-Robot Interaction
Safe Robot Control Architectures
Vision-Language Model Applications
Robotic System Integration
Understanding the capabilities and limitations of VLMs in direct robot control is crucial for:

Developing more intuitive robot interfaces
Identifying architectural requirements for safe language-based control
Advancing the field of embodied AI
Improving robot accessibility for non-expert users
